Background and Research Problem\n\nWith a global pandemic unfolding, part of our response has been that many people are working from home. With that being the case, it may not be necessary to remain living in a city where the cost of living tends to be hights, just to be in proximity to employment. Remote work has made it possible for some people to consider moving from large cities to suburbs and smaller towns, where there is less urban density and more space. Until now, people have congregated in cities for many reasons, including access to the employment available there, the communities there, and some of the ammenities available in larger urban environments. \n\nIn this study, we consider the example of Toronto and set out to look for towns in Southern Ontario that might best suit some of those looking to leave central Toronto. \n\nThis study aims at readers who wish to leave Toronto while giving up as little of the quality of life to which they have become accustomed as possible. \n\nIn the study, we make a number of assumptions. First, our readers are in a position where they may move out of the downtown core of Toronto but do not wish to stray too far away from their family, friends and existing social relationships - we shall restrict ourselves to an area within 100km of Toronto. Second, we will limit our search to neighbourhoods around a train station within this area, for several reasons. Train stations represent a higher order of mobility options, which itself has practical benefits. In addition, train stations tend only to operate where there is sufficient demand, and as such, correlate highly with other urban quality of life characteristics. We can therefore use train stations as a proxy for quality of life characteristics otherwise diffficult to measure. \n"}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "markdown", "source": "## 2. Data\n\n\nThe data we will use for this study will be familiar to peer learners of this course. \n\nFoursquare offers basic location data we can build on, including train stations near to Toronto, including their longitude, latitude, and municipality. \n\nAlso available are data on venues in different neighbourhoods, including descriptions of caf\u00e9s, restaurants of different types, and other kinds of venues. Taken together, the collection of venues in a given neighbourhood can tell us a lot about the atmosphere and quality of life of that neighbourhood. \n\nBuilding on the locations of train stations within our search area, we can therefore use the Foursquare data of what venues are most common around those locations to find neighbourhoods around train stations in Southern Ontario with neighbourhoods most like the big city. \n\n"}], "metadata": {"kernelspec": {"name": "python3", "display_name": "Python 3.7", "language": "python"}, "language_info": {"name": "python", "version": "3.7.9", "mimetype": "text/x-python", "codemirror_mode": {"name": "ipython", "version": 3}, "pygments_lexer": "ipython3", "nbconvert_exporter": "python", "file_extension": ".py"}}, "nbformat": 4, "nbformat_minor": 1}
